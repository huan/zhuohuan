<p align="center"><img SRC="../images/zmud.gif" align="center" WIDTH="39" HEIGHT="50"></font> </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">　　<font face="Lucida Sans">A few yeas before, the people only can 
contact with a few other people near them. And if somebody have friends or relatives far a 
way from him, he should spend a lot time to keep in touch with them. Such as write letters 
and began to wait the letter in reply. It is very weak. The telephone and telegram is 
useful when you have some emergencies, but it only can take very few messages and it will 
cost you a lot of money if you make a trunk call. Now, you have a new way to do that kind 
of things: use Internet.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">　　<font face="Lucida Sans">I just mean the Internet can shorten the 
space among the people, it can help us to do something that we didn</font>’<font face="Lucida Sans">t think we can do when there have no Internet. For example, you can 
call a human to have a talk with you in the Internet. Perhaps you never know that human 
and he never know you before, and perhaps he is in the North American, you are in Peking. 
The Internet let you do it very easy. And many people get to know by this way.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">　　<font face="Lucida Sans">In fact, the Internet can do much more 
things than I have just preferred. For example, the world wide wed can help you get 
anything that you want to know. The News Group have almost every kind of discuss groups 
and you can ask questions in the group, (you can answer other</font>’<font face="Lucida Sans">s questions too.) and then someone will answer your question. The 
people who answered you may in India. of course, he also can be a college student in 
Tsinghua. The FTP(File Translate Protocol) will help you get any kind of software you 
like. The Archie will help you to find out which FTP have the software that you want to 
own. ETC. But the most interest things is contact with others by the Internet: contact the 
people who you have already known or you will never meet each other.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">　　<font face="Lucida Sans">The MUD was written by a college 
professor first some years before, in order to test the activities of people in the 
virtual world through the Internet. In the MUD, everyone can act a character like the real 
word, you can get to know a lot of friends, you can go out for a walk you also can feel 
love and hate. it is so interesting that after then, many people begin to write MUD, and 
the MUD have more and more player and is more and more like the real word.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">　　<font face="Lucida Sans">The first MUD written by Chinese maybe 
in Taiwan, I think. And it is said that the first Chinese MUD in mainland(</font>大陆<font face="Lucida Sans">) is written by Afei.(Afei is the administrator of Tsinghua BBS). After 
then, the Chinese MUD site become more and more. And a lot of people love it very much.. 
Now, most of the Chinese MUD is the</font>武侠<font face="Lucida Sans">type.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">　　<font face="Lucida Sans">When you first play it, you can choice 
the id of yours(What</font>’<font face="Lucida Sans">s id? It just stand for you in that 
virtual word), after do that, you can name your character and decide either male or female 
you character is.(certainly, you must define your pass word). Here, I guess your id is 
pretty, and you name is Rose. Then you will come into that virtual world. When you come 
here, your age is 14, and you don</font>’<font face="Lucida Sans">t know if you are 
clever or foolish, you are beautiful or ugly, strong or week. These may change and you can 
know them when you at age16 if you are girl or when you are at age 18 if you a boy. You 
can see many message on your screen and you can use several commands in order to have some 
actions. For example, you can type </font>“<font face="Lucida Sans">look</font>” <font face="Lucida Sans">command to look the place where you are in. You can type </font>“<font face="Lucida Sans">go east</font>” <font face="Lucida Sans">to walk to the east,(if 
there have a way to east) when you reach a place, the MUD will display some message to 
describe the place where you in. From the message, you can get to know where here is, what 
here have and who is in here. And if there have somebody, you can type </font>“<font face="Lucida Sans">say Some Message</font>” <font face="Lucida Sans">to speak. For 
example, if you type the command </font>“<font face="Lucida Sans">say Hello! I</font>’<font face="Lucida Sans">m glade to meet you!</font>” <font face="Lucida Sans">and I am in the 
same place as you, then, I will see the message: </font>“<font face="Lucida Sans">Rose 
said: Hello! I</font>’<font face="Lucida Sans">m glade to meet you!</font>”<font face="Lucida Sans">. If you like to have a talk with me, you can do it very easy by this 
way.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">　　<font face="Lucida Sans">If you want to be a Knight, The MUD also 
can help you. There have many skills in the MUD, you can learn it and start exercise it in 
order to improve it. The world is very dangerous, and you must be careful. Someone who are 
elder than you is loving killing. They always walk from here to there in order to find 
somebody to kill</font>…<font face="Lucida Sans">.. But there also have some people who 
love to help others. So when you meet some problem, you can ask other for help. Commonly, 
you can get help very easy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">　　<font face="Lucida Sans">Another interesting thing in the MUD is 
CHATTING. MUD have many EMOTES.(them is some command and when you type one, it stand for 
some actions done by you). The chatting command is </font>“<font face="Lucida Sans">chat*</font>”<font face="Lucida Sans">. For example, If you feel angry to somebody and you want to kick him 
(or her), and his id is </font>“<font face="Lucida Sans">wolf</font>”<font face="Lucida Sans">, you can type the command </font>“<font face="Lucida Sans">chat* 
kick wolf</font>”<font face="Lucida Sans">. The screen may appear some message like 
this: </font>“<font face="Lucida Sans">CHAT: Rose kick wolf on his arse, the wolf cry 
loudly.</font>” <font face="Lucida Sans">And the MUD have a lot of this kind of EMOTE 
commands, and most of them is easy to understand. Such as </font>“<font face="Lucida Sans">love</font>”<font face="Lucida Sans">, </font>“<font face="Lucida Sans">hit</font>”<font face="Lucida Sans">, </font>“<font face="Lucida Sans">shrug</font>”<font face="Lucida Sans">, </font>“<font face="Lucida Sans">cry</font>”<font face="Lucida Sans">, </font>“<font face="Lucida Sans">sob</font>”<font face="Lucida Sans">, </font>“<font face="Lucida Sans">wink</font>”<font face="Lucida Sans">, ETC.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">　　<font face="Lucida Sans">The MUD is like a real word. Everyone in 
it feel it like a human</font>’<font face="Lucida Sans">s real life. You grow from young 
to old, from be killed to killed others, you may be very rich, or you may be very poor 
too. When you grown up, (that means the boy is 20 and the girl is 18) you can get married 
with others. I think it is the most important things in the virtual word. I have just got 
married. My wedding was very jollification and I feel as if I was really got married. When 
you grow too old, you will die. Just because this, because the successful of virtual real 
word, there have so many people enjoy MUD. It hasn</font>’<font face="Lucida Sans">t the 
beautiful pictures, and it even hasn</font>’<font face="Lucida Sans">t the simplest 
music. But it virtual a kind of world, and everyone can find the own place in it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">　　<font face="Lucida Sans">MUD, I love it. But some people who 
never played mud may not understand the MUD player. Why? Because they didn</font>’<font face="Lucida Sans">t know what the virtual world looks like, they never have the feeling 
of make friends through the Internet, in that virtual world. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">　　<font face="Lucida Sans">Perhaps they will have no feelings 
forever. But the virtual world through Internet, the MUD, is EXCELENT! </font></p>
